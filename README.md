## Development

As contributors, we are committed to developing this site to be more inclusive. Ideas for future development include:

- differentiating patron/customer logins from restaurant owner logins ins (where restaurants have administrative access to the site)
- development of a niche to better distinguish the app from Yelp (e.g patrons who are seeking gluten-free, dairy/lactose-free, or nut-free options)
- Voting capability - so patrons/customers can vote and easily see top rated restaurants on their dashboard
- Personalized dashboards - where patrons/customers can see restaurants they make like based on their interests/preferences, or recently visited restaurants
